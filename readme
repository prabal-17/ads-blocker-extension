For your GitHub README file, you can add images to showcase your project’s functionality, such as a project logo or screenshot of the extension interface. Here’s a sample markdown for including the images in your README:

1. **Project Logo or Overview Image**: Place this at the top of the README file.
2. **Before and After Ad-Blocking Screenshots**: Add these under a **Usage** or **How It Works** section to visually demonstrate the ad-blocking capabilities.
